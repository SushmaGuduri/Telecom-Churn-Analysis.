# **ðŸ“Œ Telecommunication Churn Analysis & Deployment**
#### ðŸš€ This project focuses on analyzing customer churn in the telecom industry using machine learning techniques. The goal is to identify key factors influencing customer retention and deploy a predictive model to help businesses reduce churn.

 # **Project Overview**
-- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key churn indicators.

-- Built Machine Learning models to predict customer churn.

-- Evaluated models using accuracy, precision-recall, and AUC-ROC scores.

-- Deployed the model using Flask and Streamlit.
